# packages, repositories, scripts that I've not yet implemented

## aesthetic

- https://github.com/jeffmhubbard/multilockscreen

This is a multimonitor lock screen that looks nice; it also seems to have hdpi support, which I desprately need. 

## misc

- https://github.com/captn3m0/Scripts

A bunch of useful-looking scripts I'm not done browsing through.

- https://github.com/blackjack4494/youtube-dlc

Replacement for youtube-dl, since it seems to be dying.
