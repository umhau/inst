# packages, repositories, scripts that I've not yet implemented

## system tools

https://hackaday.com/2020/11/05/linux-fu-monitor-disks/

## programming tools

https://github.com/solemnwarning/rehex A cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac) hex editor for reverse engineering, and everything else.

## functional

https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-samba#4-setting-up-user-accounts-and-connecting-to-share A standard share folder on each computer. put it somewhere like ~/system/shared, and automatically set up a password.

https://jdownloader.org/download/index Really awesome (java based...) download manager. The install script pulls more stuff from online; I want to grab a finished installation and repackage it, so that I don't have to worry about offline installations (or when the software disappears?).

https://github.com/ispc/ispc/ Interesting tool that I'll probably want to try at some point.

https://github.com/mcpcpc/kirc Move from Hexchat. With something like this, I can keep it running in the terminal on an always-on computer.

https://nextcloud.com/ File storage and for synching contacts and calendars.

https://virt-manager.org/ KVM virtual machine manager instead of virtualbox. It's time to graduate. VB is training wheels. Virt-manager is mature and feature-complete, and RedHat has discontinued it in favour of cockpit. The virt-manager application is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines through libvirt. It primarily targets KVM VMs, but also manages Xen and LXC (linux containers). It presents a summary view of running domains, their live performance & resource utilization statistics. Wizards enable the creation of new domains, and configuration & adjustment of a domainâ€™s resource allocation & virtual hardware. An embedded VNC and SPICE client viewer presents a full graphical console to the guest domain.

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24702106 I wrote this simple program to read the raw input from the synaptics driver and recognize two-, three-, four-, and five-finger tap and swipe gestures from the raw event stream generated by the synaptics driver per the kernel multi-touch protocol [1]. I initially wrote it in an evening after studying the protocol to get just simple back/forward swipe navigations working with the only actually good touchpad drivers for Linux I could find (the synaptics one), and intended to clean it up before throwing it on GitHub for anyone else that might find it interesting but realized I wasn't sufficiently motivated to clean it up anytime soon so decided to just upload it as-is.  sygesture [2] is written in rust and processes the raw MT protocol events generated by the trackpad in real-time to recognize multitouch gestures. Currently it spawns an `evtest` instance rather than opening the input device directly, that was a hack to not have to deal with translating the binary protocol but adds a dependency on the `evtest` utility (should be in your package manager). The path to device is also hard-coded in `main.rs` (and currently it only supports a single input device), but all that is separated from the actual parsing logic because I planned on making that modular from the start, but never got around to it. The mapping of gesture to action is also hard-coded in `main.rs` and isn't currently configurable. (It's all very easy to change even if you don't know rust, as all it does is spawn a program with certain arguments in response to each motion.) I'll throw an MIT license in the repo as soon as I get a chance. The utility is pretty bulletproof, even though the heuristic is fairly simple (the rationale behind the consensus algorithm is documented in the comments). It's extremely fast (don't have a reliable way to measure lag, but I'm extremely sensitive to it and don't detect any) and has low memory usage (CPU usage is basically zero except for the duration of a gesture, if you're polling at a high-enough frequency to pick up on that).

https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling The purpose of this list is to track and compare tunneling solutions. This is primarily targeted toward self-hosters and developers who want to do things like exposing a local webserver via a public domain name, with automatic HTTPS.

### RSS

https://www.freshrss.org/ (For the recommendation, see here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24539771) A better RSS reader, that I can host and that won't be dependent on any particular desktop computer.

https://newsboat.org/ Newsboat is an RSS/Atom feed reader for the text console. Even better (maybe?) than freshrss, since I can use it with a terminal. Could be nice to host it on my system and be able to access it from anywhere.

## aesthetic

https://github.com/jeffmhubbard/multilockscreen This is a multimonitor lock screen that looks nice; it also seems to have hdpi support, which I desprately need. 

## misc

https://github.com/captn3m0/Scripts A bunch of useful-looking scripts I'm not done browsing through.

https://github.com/blackjack4494/youtube-dlc Replacement for youtube-dl, since it might be dying.
