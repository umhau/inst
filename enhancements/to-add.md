# packages, repositories, scripts that I've not yet implemented

## functional

https://www.freshrss.org/ (For the recommendation, see here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24539771) A better RSS reader, that I can host and that won't be dependent on any particular desktop computer.


https://github.com/ispc/ispc/ Interesting tool that I'll probably want to try at some point.

https://github.com/mcpcpc/kirc Move from Hexchat. With something like this, I can keep it running in the terminal on an always-on computer.

https://nextcloud.com/ Ffile storage and for synching contacts and calendars.

https://virt-manager.org/ KVM virtual machine manager instead of virtualbox. It's time to graduate. VB is training wheels. Virt-manager is mature and feature-complete, and RedHat has discontinued it in favour of cockpit. The virt-manager application is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines through libvirt. It primarily targets KVM VMs, but also manages Xen and LXC (linux containers). It presents a summary view of running domains, their live performance & resource utilization statistics. Wizards enable the creation of new domains, and configuration & adjustment of a domainâ€™s resource allocation & virtual hardware. An embedded VNC and SPICE client viewer presents a full graphical console to the guest domain.

## aesthetic

https://github.com/jeffmhubbard/multilockscreen This is a multimonitor lock screen that looks nice; it also seems to have hdpi support, which I desprately need. 

## misc

https://github.com/captn3m0/Scripts A bunch of useful-looking scripts I'm not done browsing through.

https://github.com/blackjack4494/youtube-dlc Replacement for youtube-dl, since it seems to be dying.
