pie menu

long press to activate? or just touch to activate? 

T = TOUCH

top level - fastest access

T+LEFT = initiate scrolling with touch mouse
T+RIGHT = right click menu activation 

voice activated assistant? 

i3 manipulation commands - see other tool. submenu to move/delete/create windows, change workspaces, move windows between workspaces, etc.

application launcher - complete, sorted by category. useful for discoverability.


onscreen keyboard (use the suckless keyboard)
T+DOWN = fancy screenshot & save function

use a very quick timeout to determine when to open the menu - basically, the user either made a quick touch to press a button, or they are trying to open the menu. (can the menu be used by releaseing over the selected item? )
