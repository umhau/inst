# man acpid

# The action value is a commandline, which will be invoked via /bin/sh
# whenever an event matching the rule in question occurs.  The
# commandline may include shell-special characters, and they will be
# preserved.  The only special characters in an action value are "%"
# escaped.  The string "%e" will be replaced by the literal text of the
# event for which the action was invoked.  This string may contain
# spaces, so the commandline must take care to quote the "%e" if it wants
# a single token.  The string "%%" will be replaced by a literal "%".
# All other "%" escapes are reserved, and will cause a rule to not load.

# This feature allows multiple rules to be defined for the same event
# (though no ordering is guaranteed), as well as one rule to be defined
# for multiple events.  To force acpid to reload the rule configuration,
# send it a SIGHUP.
